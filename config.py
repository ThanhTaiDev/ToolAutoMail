Formal Ip Appeal – Abusive Enforcement (meta)

FORMAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY APPEAL
REGARDING SYSTEMIC BAD-FAITH ABUSE OF COPYRIGHT & TRADEMARK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

To: Meta / Facebook – Intellectual Property & Legal Enforcement Team

Dear Meta / Facebook Intellectual Property Team,

My name is Vo Van Thanh Tai, Attorney-at-Law. I hereby submit this appeal in my professional legal capacity as duly authorized counsel, acting pursuant to valid, lawful, and continuing Powers of Attorney granted by the clients identified herein.

Client has expressly empowered me to represent them before Meta / Facebook in all matters relating to copyright, trademark, name, identity, and intellectual property enforcement, including the submission of formal appeals, legal objections, counter‑notices, and demands for restoration of accounts, Pages, Groups, content, and access rights.

This submission constitutes a FORMAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY APPEAL ARISING FROM SYSTEMIC, DELIBERATE, AND BAD‑FAITH ABUSE OF META’S COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS, and does not arise from any legitimate or substantiated allegation of intellectual property infringement.

I. LEGAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS APPEAL

The enforcement actions challenged herein do not result from lawful intellectual property protection. Rather, they demonstrate a coordinated pattern of:

Copyright complaints failing to identify any specific, valid, or protectable copyrighted work, in violation of statutory requirements;

Trademark claims asserted without trademark use in commerce, source identification, consumer confusion, or any legally cognizable infringement element;

Automated, cascading, or derivative restrictions imposed without individualized human legal review;

Clear indicators of material misrepresentation, bad‑faith reporting, and procedural abuse, intended to disrupt lawful personal identity, business activity, and community operation.

Such conduct constitutes abuse of intellectual property rights, copyright misrepresentation, and the unlawful weaponization of Meta’s enforcement mechanisms, contrary to fundamental principles of due process and proportional enforcement.

II. CLIENT IDENTIFICATION, FACEBOOK LINKS, REPORT NUMBERS & LEGAL BASIS FOR RESTORATION

Client Name: Uyên Uyên

Asset Type: Facebook Profile (Personal Name & Identity Rights)

Facebook Profile Link:
https://www.facebook.com/100026678942044

Report Number:
Trademark (Charles & Keith International Pte. Ltd.) – 988155476691670 – 4679222755636950

Legal Analysis & Mandatory Restoration Requirement:
This profile does not use, display, promote, sell, reference, or otherwise exploit the Charles & Keith International Pte. Ltd. trademark. There is no commercial use, no branding activity, and no likelihood of consumer confusion.

The trademark complaint is therefore legally unfounded, evidentially unsupported, and abusive. All restrictions must be lifted and full restoration implemented without delay.

III. LEGAL FINDINGS – SYSTEMATIC AND DELIBERATE BAD‑FAITH ABUSE

The above enforcement actions demonstrate a systematic pattern of bad‑faith abuse, including copyright misrepresentation, trademark claims without use in commerce, and unlawful interference with lawful personal, business, and community identity.

Such conduct constitutes bad‑faith exploitation of Meta’s intellectual property enforcement systems and undermines fundamental due process protections owed to lawful users.

IV. FORMAL LEGAL DEMAND FOR CORRECTIVE RELIEF

On behalf of my clients, I hereby formally and unequivocally demand that Meta / Facebook:

Conduct a manual, individualized, and legally competent human review of each referenced report;

Invalidate, dismiss, and permanently close all abusive copyright and trademark claims identified herein;

Restore in full and without condition all affected accounts, Pages, Groups, and content;

Remove all enforcement records, strikes, limitations, internal flags, and risk indicators;

Implement safeguards to prevent further bad‑faith or abusive intellectual property reporting against my clients.

V. CERTIFICATION BY LEGAL COUNSEL

I certify under penalty of perjury that I am duly authorized to represent the above‑named clients, that all factual and legal statements contained herein are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge, and that this appeal is submitted in good faith and for lawful purposes only.

Supporting documentation, including executed Powers of Attorney, will be produced upon request.

VI. FINAL LEGAL NOTICE

This submission constitutes a formal legal notice and intellectual property appeal arising from bad‑faith abuse of enforcement mechanisms. Meta’s intellectual property systems must not be weaponized to suppress lawful identity, expression, community activity, or legitimate business operations.

Prompt legal correction, strict due‑process compliance, and full restoration are formally demanded and reasonably expected.

Respectfully submitted,

Vo Van Thanh Tai
Attorney‑at‑Law
Authorized Legal Representative
